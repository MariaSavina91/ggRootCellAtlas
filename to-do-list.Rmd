## Ideas to improve

### 001 Data folder
At the moment you need to manually save data folder from the package to your folder, so that the functions works. Needs to be improved.

### 002 Signal saturation

If the value is below or abov the thersholds one sets, than the cells turned black (signal is not detected), although it can be set to the maximal/minimal value.

### 003 Scales

There should be an option for different scales. Different colors, but also for divergent scales, like with PCA functions
